this project is API-only. any webpages are mostly for testing.

once the important stuff is done, we need to move on to writing the clientside.

I dream of having seperate bitview-alike pure-html/cookie clients,
ajax-intensive webapps, and native desktop apps all interacting
with the same platform, just by seperating the API and client.

beautiful vision, is it not?
